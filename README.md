# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The task was to refactor HTML markup and consolidate the CSS. This was done to make the code more accessible to different viewing styles. It allows users with disabilities to better understand the webpage that they are viewing. I learned that many different tags can be used as containers. Also CSS selectors can be combined to make the sheet more effecient.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use, view HTML code in an easy to read format following semantic guidelines. Also view the attached CSS sheet to check for styling redundancies.
